Data on Portland CSOs was received in e-mails from Denis Welch, of
Portland Water District, sent to Curtis C. Bohlen.

Dennis sends monthly summaries of CSO activity to a list of water quality
stakeholders, including CBEP.  Data includes information on both discharge
volumes by CSO and rainfall data, in separate Excel files.

December reports each year contain data for the previous 12 months, providing a
convenient annual summary.
 
In some cases, (e.g., 2015 data) these results have not been certified as "FINAL",
but they are thought to be correct.

Portland CSO Data came from from e-mails from Dennis Welch, of PWD, sent

*  1/11/2016,  
*  3/2/2017,   
*  1/26/2018,   
*  1/30/2019,
*  10/01/2020.

2016, 2017, and 2018 data were in CCB e-mail archives, under
"Nutrients and water quality / CSOs". Apparently, older e-mails are
automatically deleted from GMail. The 2015 e-mail is no longer accessible.
The 2015 data was retrieved from archives of data analysis related to preparing
the Nutrient Council report several years ago.

A request for the complete 2019 data was sent to Denis Welch on September 30,
2020. He responded October 1, 2020 with the 2019 files, in two separate e-mails.

E-mails contained both CSO volume and rainfall data, in separate excel 
spreadsheets.  Rainfall data includes both daily rainfall totals and the highest 
hourly rainfall of the day.

Notice that the data from 2015 uses a slightly different data format.  It is
structured with a row for each DAY within events.  All other data sheets have a
row for each EVENT, with a start date and an end date.
