## GIS Data
The original geospatial data was downloaded on September 12, 2019 by
Curtis C. Bohlen, from:
https://geolibrary-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainedep-cso

This file contains a statewide CSO data layer, derived from permit data.
The file includes both "Active" and "Inactive" CSOs.  Our analysis focuses
on the "Active" CSOs.

## Weather and Precipitation Data
The Annual Portland Jetport weather data was downloaded from NOAA's
National Centers for Environmental Information using a small Python program,
"noaaweatherdataGUI.py", written by CBEP staff.  The program is available
upon request, or in other data analysis archives related
to 2020 State of Casco Bay, including
[CDO-Portland-Jetport](https://github.com/ccb60/CDO-Portland-Jetport).

Data was downloaded to the file "Annual_Weather_PWD.csv" in "Long" format,
based on the "GSOY", or Global Summary of the Year data format.  Annual
total precipitation, the only value used here, is "PRCP".
