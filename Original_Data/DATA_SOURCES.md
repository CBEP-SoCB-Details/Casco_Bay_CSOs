The Annual Portland Jetport weather data was downloaded from NOAA's
National Centers for Environmental Information using a small Python program,
"noaaweatherdataGUI.py", written by CBEP staf.  The program is available
upon request, or in other data analysis archives related
to 2020 State of Casco Bay, including
[CDO-Portland-Jetport](https://github.com/ccb60/CDO-Portland-Jetport).

Data was downloaded to the file "Annual_Weather_PWD.csv" in "Long" format,
based on the "GSOY", or Global Summary of the Year data format.  Annual
total precipitation, the only value used here, is "PRCP".
