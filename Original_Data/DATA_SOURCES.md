Data was received in e-mails from Denis Welch, of Portland Water District to
Curtis C. Bohlen.

Dennis sends monthly summaries of CSO activity to a list of water quality
stakeholders, including CBEP.

December reports each year contain data for the previous 12 months, providing a
convenient annual summary.

2016, 2017, and 2018 data were in CCB e-mail archives.  The 2015 data was found
in archives used for preparing the Nutrient Council report several years ago. 
Older e-mails have apparently been deleted automatically from GMail.

A request for complete 2019 data was sent to Denis Welch on September 30, 2020.
He responded October 1 with the 2019 file.

Portland CSO Data came from from e-mails from Dennis Welch, of PWD, sent

*  1/11/2016,  
*  3/2/2017,   
*  1/26/2018,   
*  1/30/2019,
*  10/01/2020.

These emails are archived in CCB's e-mails under
"Nutrients and water quality / CSOs", but apparently, older e-mails are
automatically deleted from GMail.

E-mails contain both CSO volume and rainfall data, in excel spreadsheets.

Notice that the data from 2015 uses a slightly different data format.  It is
structured with a row for each DAY within events.  All other data sheets have a
row for each EVENT, with a start date and an end date.
