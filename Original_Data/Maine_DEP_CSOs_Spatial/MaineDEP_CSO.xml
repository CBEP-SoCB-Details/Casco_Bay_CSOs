<abstract>This data shows the location of active and closed CSO outfall pipes licensed under the Maine Pollution Discharge Elimination System (MEPDES).  Data was collected for this
project under two separate contracts and was overseen by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP). Part 1 was from 1998 to 1999 under a Geo-graphics contract and Part 2 was from 2000 to 2001 under a contract with Northern Ecological Associates. Data was collected using Trimble Pro-XR GPS receivers that have corrected accuracy of +/- 1 meter. Since the original data collection, MEDEP staff have maintained the layer.  During the fall and winter of 2018, a water quality environmental engineer reviewed the CSO data for completeness and location quality, prior to public re-release.</abstract>
