## Source
Maine Department of Environmental Protection provides annual CSO 
monitoring reports, which include large data tables showing measured or
estimated CSO VOlumes going back to teh late 1980s.

CSO Reports URL: https://www.maine.gov/dep/water/cso/#supp

The 2016, 2017, and 2018 reports were downloaded from that web site by Tyler
Walsh on December 17th, 2019.  The 2019 Report was downloaded by Curtis C. 
Bohlen on  June 15, 2020.

Each report contains data set from recent years only.  The 2019 report shows
data from 1987 through 2019, but it omits 1989 through 2004 "for legibility."

CBEP has retained a copy of DEP's 2008 report in our archives, which includes
the older data.  However, much of the data collected before the mid 1990s was
estimated, and not measured, so it is not especially helpful in this context.
